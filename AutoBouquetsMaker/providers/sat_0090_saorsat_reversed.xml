<!-- Saorsat is transmitted in the Ka band with left circular polarity. It is received using a special Ka band LNB that emulates a
     standard Ku band universal LNB, downconverting the received Ka band signal into the Ku band frequency range and converting
     left circular to vertical polarity. Saorsat cannot be received (and this provider will not work) with a standard universal LNB.
     The double-reflector design of a toroidal dish like the Wavefrontier T90 effectively reverses the received polarity to right
     circular, which the LNB converts to horizontal. This version of the Saorsat provider specifies horizontal polarity for users
     of such dishes. -->
